description: 'OpenFiles provides file operations for AI agents through SDKs and REST API. Your agents can create, read, edit, and manage files with automatic versioning.'
---

OpenFiles integrates with your AI application through three approaches:

1. **Direct Integrations** - Drop-in replacement for OpenAI SDK with automatic file operations
2. **Tools** - Provider-specific tool definitions for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI providers
3. **Core SDK & REST API** - Direct file operations without AI dependencies


## File Storage

- **Paths**: Specify paths without a leading slash (`docs/readme.md`)
- **Versioning**: Automatic version tracking for all changes
- **Size Limit**: 10MB per file operation

## Authentication

All operations require an API key from [console.openfiles.ai](https://console.openfiles.ai).

```bash
# Set environment variable
export OPENFILES_API_KEY="oa_your_key_here"
```
